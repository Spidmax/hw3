### What are the four parts of a `for` loop? What do they do?
#### Prerequisites
Initializing a variable: setting up a number to keep track of the amount of loop. 

Condition for repetition: the required environment to continue the loop & the boundaries of ending the loop.

Incrementation: the amount of increase of the set variable between each loop. 
#### Action
Action: the actual code being repeated in the loop. 

### What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?
The 3 prerequisites are scattered in a `while` loop. The variable initialization is outside the loop, the condition is defined in the bracket, and the incrementation is at the end of the loop actions. 
A `for` loop combines the 3 prerequisites inside the bracket. 

### What does “nested” mean in the context of nested loops?
“Nested” means that a loop is living inside another loop. A cycle of the outside loop will not finish until the inside loop finishes.
